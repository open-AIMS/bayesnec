\usage{
expand_nec(object, x_range = NA, precision = 1000, sig_val = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class prebayesnecfit.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx.}

\item{precision}{The length of the x vector used for posterior predictions,
and over which to extract ECx values. Large values will be slower but more
precise.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test
significance of the predicted posterior values
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to
estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}
}
\value{
An object of class bayesnecfit.
}
\description{
Assigns class to a prebayesnecfit object
}
