\usage{
\method{nsec}{bayesmanecfit}(
  object,
  sig_val = 0.01,
  precision = 1000,
  posterior = FALSE,
  x_range = NA,
  hormesis_def = "control",
  xform = NA,
  prob_vals = c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} returned by
\code{\link{bnec}}.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test
significance of the predicted posterior values.
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to
estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{precision}{The number of unique x values over which to find nsec -
large values will make the nsec estimate more precise.}

\item{posterior}{A \code{\link[base]{logical}} value indicating if the full
posterior sample of calculated nsec values should be returned instead of
just the median and 95 credible intervals.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting nsec.}

\item{hormesis_def}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector, taking values
of "max" or "control". See Details.}

\item{xform}{A function to apply to the returned estimated concentration
values.}

\item{prob_vals}{A vector indicating the probability values over which to
return the estimated nsec value. Defaults to 0.5 (median) and 0.025 and
0.975 (95 percent credible intervals).}
}
\value{
A vector containing the estimated nsec value, including upper and
lower 95\% credible interval bounds.
}
\description{
Extracts the predicted nsec value as desired from an object of class
\code{\link{bayesmanecfit}}.
}
\details{
For \code{hormesis_def}, if "max", then nsec values are calculated
as a decline from the maximum estimates (i.e. the peak at nec);
if "control", then ECx values are calculated relative to the control, which
is assumed to be the lowest observed concentration.
