\usage{
check_data(
  data,
  x_var,
  y_var,
  trials_var,
  x_type = NA,
  y_type = NA,
  over_disp,
  model
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame containing the data to use for the model}

\item{x_var}{the column heading indicating the concentration (x) variable}

\item{y_var}{the column heading indicating the response (y) variable}

\item{trials_var}{the column heading indicating the column for the number of "trials" for binomial response data.
If not supplied, the model may run but will not be the model you intended!}

\item{x_type}{the statistical distribution to use for the x (concentration) data. This will be guess based on the
characteristic of the input data if not supplied.

The argument \code{y_type} is a character vector indicating the family to use for the response variable in the brms call,
and may currently be one of "binomial", "beta", poisson", "negbin","gaussian", or "gamma".
Others can be added as required, please raise an issue on the github development site if your required familiy is not currently available.
If not supplied, the appropriate distribution will be guessed based on the characteristics of the input data.}

\item{over_disp}{If an overdispersed model should be used. Only changes the model fit for poisson and binomial y_type
data. For poisson, a negative binomial model will be fit. For binomial a beta model will be fit.}

\item{model}{The type of model to be fit. Currently takes values of "nec3param",
"nec4param", "necsigmoidal", "nechorme", "ecx4param", "ecxwb1", or "ecxwb2".}
