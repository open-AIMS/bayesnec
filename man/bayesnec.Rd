\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the data to use for the model}

\item{x_var}{The column heading indicating the concentration (x) variable}

\item{y_var}{The column heading indicating the response (y) variable}

\item{model}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector indicating the model(s) to fit. See details for more information.}

\item{trials_var}{The column heading indicating the column for the number of "trials" for binomial response data. If not supplied, the model may run but will not be the model you intended!}

\item{x_type}{the statistical distribution to use for the x (concentration) data. This will be guess based on the characteristic of the input data if not supplied. As some concentration-response data will use zero concentration, and there is no distribution on the continuous scale from 0 to in (ie tweedie) available in bayes,
a small offset is added (1/10^3 of the next lowest value) to zero values of concentration where these are gamma distributed.}

\item{y_type}{the statistical distribution to use for the y (response) data. This may currently be one of  'binomial', 'poisson',' 'gaussian', or 'gamma'. Others can be added as required, please contact the package maintainer.
If not supplied, the appropriate distribution will be guessed based on the distribution of the input data.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ecx.}

\item{over_disp}{If an overdispersed model should be used. Only changes the model fit for poisson and binomial y_type data.
For poisson, a negative binomial model will be fit. For binomial a beta model will be fit.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test significance of the predictor posterior values against the lowest observed concentration.
against the control, to estimate nec as an interpolated NOec value from smooth ecx curves.}

\item{iter}{the number of interations to for the brms fit. Defaults to 2e4.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to \code{\link{fit_bayesnec}}}
}
\value{
All successully fitted bayes model fits, mod.stats a data.frame of model fit statistics, nec a model
averaged posterior of the estimated nec, and pred.vals a list of model averaged predictions.
}
\description{
Fits a variety of nec models using bayes and provides a model averaged predictions based on DIC model weights
}
\details{
As some concentration-response data will use zero concentration which can cause numerical estimation issues, a small offset
is added (1/10th of the next lowest value) to zero values of concentration where x_var are distributed on a continuous scale from 0 to Inf, or are bounded to 0, or 1.

The argument \code{model} may be one of "nec3param", "nec4param", "necsigm", "nechorme", "ecx4param", "ecxwb1", "ecxwb2", "ecxexp", "ecxlin", or 'excsigm',
in which case a single model of the specified type it fit, and bayenec returns a model object of class 'bayesnecfit'.

If a vector of two or more of the available models is supplied, bayesnec returns a model object of class 'bayesmanecfit' containing
model averaged predictions for the supplied models, providing they were successfully fitted.

Model averaging is acheived through a weighted sample of each fitted models posterior predictions, with weights derived using the \code{\link{loo_model_weights}} from \code{\link{brms}}
Individual model fits can be extracted from the $mod_fits element and can be examined individually.

\code{model} may also be one of "all", meaning all of the available models will be fit;
"ecx" meaning only models excluding a specific nec step parameter fill be fit; "nec" meaning only models with a specific nec step parameter will be fit;
or "bot_free" meaning only models without a 'bot' parameter (without a bottom plataeu) will be fit.

Models are fit using model formula passed to brms. You can view the model formula for each type X_HOW_X.
Other types can be added as required, please open an issue at the packge site on github to request an additional model.

All models provide an estimate for nec. For model types with "nec" as a prefix, nec is directly estimated as a paremeter
in the model. Models with "ecx" as a prefix are continuous curve models, tyipically used for extracting ecx values
from concentration response data. In this instance the nec value is defined as the concentration at which there is
a user supplied (see \code{sig_val}) percentage certainty (based on the Bayesian posterior estimate) that the response falls below the estimated value of
the upper assymptote (top) of the response (i.e the response value is significantly lower than that expected in the case of
no exposure).
