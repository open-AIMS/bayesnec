\usage{
amend(
  object,
  drop,
  add,
  x_range = NA,
  precision = 1000,
  sig_val = 0.01,
  priors
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}}, as returned by \code{\link{bnec}}.}

\item{drop}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector containing the names of model types you which to drop for the modified fit.}

\item{add}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector containing the names of model types to add to the modified fit.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx.}

\item{precision}{The length of the x vector used for posterior predictions, and over which to extract ECx values. Large values will be slower but more precise.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test significance of the predictor posterior values
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{priors}{An object of class \code{\link[brms]{brmsprior}} which specifies user-desired prior distributions of model parameters.
If missing, \code{\link{bnec}} will figure out a baseline prior for each parameter.}
}
\value{
All successfully fitted model fits, either as a \code{\link{bayesnecfit}} (1 model case)
or \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} (multiple models case) object.
}
\description{
Amends an existing \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} object, for example, by adding or removing fitted models.
