\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}}, as returned
by \code{\link{bnec}}.}

\item{drop}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector containing the names of
model types you which to drop for the modified fit.}

\item{add}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector containing the names of
model types to add to the modified fit.}

\item{loo_controls}{A named \code{\link[base]{list}} containing the desired
arguments to be passed on to \code{\link[loo]{loo_model_weights}}. It can
be used to change the default method from "pseudobma". See help
documentation ?loo_model_weights from package loo.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx.}

\item{precision}{The length of the x vector used for posterior predictions,
and over which to extract ECx values. Large values will be slower but more
precise.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test
significance of the predicted posterior values
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to
estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{priors}{An object of class \code{\link[brms]{brmsprior}} which
specifies user-desired prior distributions of model parameters.
If missing, \code{\link{bnec}} will figure out a baseline prior for each
parameter. It can also be specified as a named \code{\link[base]{list}}
where each name needs to correspond to the same string as "model". See
details.}

\item{pointwise}{A flag indicating whether to compute the full log-likelihood matrix
at once or separately for each observation. The latter approach is usually considerably slower but requires
much less working memory. Accordingly, if one runs into memory issues, pointwise = TRUE is the way to go,
but will not work for the custom family beta_binomial2}
}
\value{
All successfully fitted \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} model fits.
}
\description{
Amends an existing \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} object, for example, by
adding or removing fitted models.
