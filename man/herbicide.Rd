\description{
Herbicide phytotoxicity dataset from Jones & Kerswell (2003).
}
\details{
The response data (Fv/Fm) Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of symbiotic
dinoflagellates still in the host tissue of the coral
(in hospite or in vivo) were measured using a DIVING-PAM chlorophyll
fluorometer (Walz) on vertical planes of tissue 2 to 3 cm above the base of
the corals, using either a 6 mm (Acropora formosa) or 2 mm
(Seriatopora hystrix) fibre-optic probe. Parameters measured were the
maximum potential quantum yield (Fv/Fm).

Additional information on each of the herbicides included is available from
the original publication Jones & Kerswell (2003).

The columns are as follows:

\describe{
\item{herbicide}{The herbicide (chr).}
\item{concentration}{The treatment concentration in Âµg / L (dbl).}
\item{fvfm}{Maximum effective quantum yield (dbl).}
