\description{
Herbicide phytotoxicity dataset from \insertRef{Jones2003}{bayesnec}.
}
\details{
The response data (fvfm) Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of symbiotic dinoflagellates
still in the host tissue of the coral (in hospite or in vivo) were measured using a DIVING-PAM chlorophyll
fluorometer (Walz) on vertical planes of tissue 2
to 3 cm above the base of the corals, using either a
6 mm (Acropora formosa) or 2 mm (Seriatopora hystrix)
fibre-optic probe. Parameters measured were the
maximum potential quantum yield (Fv/Fm).

Additional information on each of the herbicides included is available from the original
publication \insertRef{Jones2003}{bayesnec}

The columns are as follows:

\describe{
\item{name}{The herbicide (chr).}
\item{conc}{The treatment concentration in $\mu$g L^-1^ (dbl).}
\item{fvfm}{Maximum effective quantum yield (dbl).}
