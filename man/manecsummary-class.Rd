\title{Class \code{manecsummary} of models fitted with the \pkg{brms} package}
\description{
Multiple models fitted with the
\code{\link[bayesnec:bayesnec-package]{bayesnec}} package are summarised
as a \code{manecsummary} object, which contains the name of the
non-linear models fitted, the family distribution used
to fit all the models, the total post-warm-up sample size, a table
containing the model weights, the method to calculate the weights,
whether this model is an ECx-type model
(see details below), and the ECx summary values should the user decide
to calculate them.
}
\details{
See \code{methods(class = "manecsummary")} for an overview of available
methods.

\item{\code{models}}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} string indicating the name of
the fitted non-linear models.}

\item{\code{family}}{The family distribution used to fit all the models.}

\item{\code{sample_size}}{The total post-warm-up sample size.}
