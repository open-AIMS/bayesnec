\arguments{
\item{X}{the bayes nec model fit as returned by fit.bayesnec.}

\item{CI}{a logical value indicating if confidence intervals on the model fit should be plotted, calculated as the upper and lower bounds of the individual predicted values from all posterior samples}

\item{add_nec}{a logical value indicating if the estimated nec value and 95\% credible intervals should be added to the plot.}

\item{position_legend}{a vector indicating the location of the nec or ec10 legend, as per a call to legend.}

\item{add_ec10}{a logical value indicating if an estimated ec10 value and 95\% credible intervals should be added to the plot.}

\item{xform}{a function to be applied as a transformation of the x data.}

\item{lxform}{a function to be applied as a transformation only to axis labels and the annoted nec/ec10 values.}

\item{jitter_x}{a logical value indicating if the x data points on the plot should be jittered.}

\item{jitter_y}{a logical value indicating if the y data points on the plot should be jittered.}

\item{ylab}{a character vector to use for the y-axis label}

\item{xlab}{a character vector to use for the x-axis label}

\item{x_lim}{a numeric vector of length two to use for the lower and uper limits of the x-axis range}

\item{y_lim}{a numeric vector of length two to use for the lower and uper limits of the y-axis range}

\item{xticks}{a numeric vector indicate where to place the tick marks of the x-axis}
