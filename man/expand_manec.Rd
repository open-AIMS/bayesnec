expand_manec(
  object,
  x_range = NA,
  precision = 1000,
  sig_val = 0.01,
  wi_method = "stacking"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a bayesmanecfit mod_fits output list, as returned by
\code{\link{bnec}} when more than one model is supplied.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx.}

\item{precision}{The length of the x vector used for posterior predictions, and over which to extract ECx values. Large values will be slower but more precise.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test significance of the predicted posterior values
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{wi_method}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector containing the desired weighting method to pass to \code{\link{loo_model_weights}}.}
}
\value{
A list of model statistical output derived from the input model list
}
\description{
Extracts a range of statistics from a list of bayesnecfit model fits.
