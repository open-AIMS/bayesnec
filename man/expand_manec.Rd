\usage{
expand_manec(
  object,
  formula,
  x_range = NA,
  precision = 1000,
  sig_val = 0.01,
  loo_controls
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} mod_fits output list, as
returned by \code{\link{bnec}} when more than one model is supplied.}

\item{formula}{....}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx.}

\item{precision}{The length of the x vector used for posterior predictions,
and over which to extract ECx values. Large values will be slower but more
precise.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test
significance of the predicted posterior values against the lowest observed
concentration (assumed to be the control), to estimate NEC as an
interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{loo_controls}{A named \code{\link[base]{list}} of two elements
("fitting" and/or "weights"), each being a named \code{\link[base]{list}}
containing the desired arguments to be passed on to \code{\link[brms]{loo}}
(via "fitting") or to \code{\link[loo]{loo_model_weights}} (via "weights").
If "fitting" is provided with argument \code{pointwise = TRUE}
(due to memory issues) and \code{family = "beta_binomial2"}, the
\code{\link{bnec}} will fail because that is a custom family. If "weights" is
not provided by the user, \code{\link{bnec}} will set the default
\code{method} argument in \code{\link[loo]{loo_model_weights}} to
"pseudobma". See ?\code{\link[loo]{loo_model_weights}} for further info.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[base]{list}} of model statistical output derived from
the input model list.
}
\description{
Extracts a range of statistics from a list of \code{\link{bayesnecfit}}
model fits.
