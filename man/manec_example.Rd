\title{Example bayesmanecfit object}
\format{
An object of class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}}. This was created
to reduce run time in examples and tests, and to give the user an example
to toy with. This was fitted to \code{\link{bayesnec}} built-in mock dataset
(see ?\code{\link{nec_data}}), using models "nec4param" and "ecx4param".
The number of chains were set to 2 and number of iterations were 50 only
to make sure that package size was below 5 Mb. See help files for function
\code{\link{bnec}} and class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} for details.
