\title{Example bayesmanecfit object}
\format{
An object of class \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}}. This was created
To reduce run time in examples and tests, and to give the user an example
to toy with. This was fitted to \code{\link{bayesnec}} built-in mock dataset
(see ?\code{\link{nec_data}}), using models "nec4param" and "ecx4param". See
help files for function \code{\link{bnec}} and class
\code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} for details.

Code used to generate these models can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/open-AIMS/bayesnec/tree/master/data-raw/manec_example.R}
