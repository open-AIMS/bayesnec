\usage{
models(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesnecfit}} or \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} as returned by \code{\link{bnec}},
a character vector indicating the type of model set for which to list the available models,
or a numeric vector indicating the natural range of values which the models should be able to handle (see details).
If missing all available models and their groups are listed.}
}
\value{
A list of the available or fitted models
}
\description{
Lists the fitted or available models
}
\details{
The available models are "ecx4param", "ecxexp", "ecxlin", "ecxsigm", "ecxwb1", "ecxwb2",
"nec3param", "nec4param", "nechorme", "nechorme4", "neclin", "neclinhorme" and "necsigm".

To see the model formula and parameters for a specific model use the function \code{\link{show_params}}.

To see all the models in an available set (e.g. "all", "nec" or ecx") use the function \code{\link{models}} specifying the group name.

To see the model names, model formula and parameters fitted in an existing bayesnec or bayesmanec model object use the function \code{\link{models}} specifying the fitted object.

To see what models are available for a given type of data use the function \code{\link{models}} passing a numeric vector indicating the range of possible data types. Models that have an exponential decay (most models with parameter "beta") with no "bot" parameter are zero_bounded and are not suitable for the gaussian family, or any family modelled using a logit or log link function. Models with a linear decay (containing the string "lin" in their name) are not suitable for modelling families that are zero bounded (gamma, poisson, negative binomial) using an identity link. Models with a linear decay or hormesis linear increase (all models with parameter "slope") are not suitable for modelling families that are 0, 1 bounded (binomial, beta, betabinomial2). These restrictions do not need to be controlled by the user and a call to \code{\link{bnec}} with models="all" will simply exclude inappropriate models.
