\usage{
models(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesnecfit}} or
\code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} as returned by \code{\link{bnec}},
a \code{\link[base]{character}} vector indicating the type of model set for
which to list the available models, or a \code{\link[base]{numeric}} vector
indicating the natural range of values which the models should be able to
handle (see details). If missing all available models and their groups are
listed.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[base]{list}} of the available or fitted models.
}
\description{
Lists the fitted or available models
}
\details{
The available models are "nec3param", "nec4param", "nechorme",
"nechorme4", "necsigm", "neclin", "neclinhorme", "nechormepwr",
"nechorme4pwr", "nechormepwr01", "ecxlin", "ecxexp", "ecxsigm", "ecx4param",
"ecxwb1", "ecxwb2", "ecxwb1p3", "ecxwb2p3", "ecxll5", "ecxll4", "ecxll3",
"ecxhormebc4", and "ecxhormebc5".

To see the model formula and parameters for a specific model use the
function \code{\link{show_params}}.

To see all the models in an available set (e.g. "all", "nec" or ecx") use
the function \code{\link{models}} specifying the group name.

To see the model names, model formula and parameters fitted in an existing
\code{\link{bayesnecfit}} or \code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} model object use
the function \code{\link{models}} specifying the fitted object.

To see what models are available for a given type of data use the function
\code{\link{models}} passing a \code{\link[base]{numeric}} vector indicating
the range of possible data types. Models that have an exponential decay
(most models with parameter "beta") with no "bot" parameter are zero-bounded
and are not suitable for the Gaussian family, or any family modelled using a
logit or log link function. Models with a linear decay
(containing the string "lin" in their name) are not suitable for modelling
families that are zero bounded (Gamma, Poisson, Negative binomial) using an
identity link. Models with a linear decay or hormesis linear increase
(all models with parameter "slope") are not suitable for modelling families
that are 0, 1 bounded (binomial, beta, betabinomial2). These restrictions do
not need to be controlled by the user and a call to \code{\link{bnec}} with
\code{models = "all"} will simply exclude inappropriate models.
