\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} containing the data to use for the model.}

\item{x_var}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} indicating the column heading indicating the concentration (x) variable.}

\item{y_var}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} indicating the column heading indicating the response (y) variable.}

\item{model}{A \code{\link[base]{character}} vector indicating the model(s) to fit. See Details for more information.}

\item{trials_var}{The column heading indicating the column for the number of "trials" for binomial response data.
If not supplied, the model may run but will not be the model you intended!}

\item{x_type}{the statistical distribution to use for the x (concentration) data. This will be guessed based on
the characteristic of the input data if not supplied.}

\item{y_type}{the statistical distribution to use for the y (response) data.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECX}

\item{precision}{tbw.}

\item{over_disp}{If an over-dispersed model should be used. Only changes the model fit for "poisson" and "binomial" \code{y_type}
data. For "poisson", a negative binomial model will be fit. For binomial a beta model will be fit.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test significance of the predictor posterior values
against the lowest observed concentration. Against the control, to estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECX curves.}

\item{iter}{the number of iterations to be passed to \code{\link[brms]{brm}}. Defaults to 2e4.}

\item{warmup}{A positive integer specifying number of warmup (a.k.a. burnin) iterations. This also specifies the number
of iterations used for stepsize adaptation, so warmup samples should not be used for inference. The number of warmup
should not be larger than "iter" and the default is "floor(iter / 5) * 4".}

\value{
All successfully fitted Bayesian model fits, mod.stats a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} of model fit statistics, nec a model
averaged posterior of the estimated nec, and pred.vals a list of model averaged predictions.
}
\description{
Fits a variety of NEC models using Bayesian analysis and provides a model averaged predictions based on WAIC model weights
}
\details{
As some concentration-response data will use zero concentration which can cause numerical estimation issues, a
small offset is added (1 / 10th of the next lowest value) to zero values of concentration where \code{x_var} are distributed
on a continuous scale from 0 to infinity, or are bounded to 0, or 1.

The argument \code{y_type} is a character vector indicating the family to use for the response variable in the brms call,
and may currently be one of "binomial", "beta", "poisson", "negbin", "gaussian", or "gamma".
Others can be added as required, please raise an issue on the GitHub development site if your required family is not currently available.
If not supplied, the appropriate distribution will be guessed based on the characteristics of the input data through \code{\link{check_data}}.

The argument \code{model} may be one of "nec3param", "nec4param", "necsigm", "nechorme", "ecx4param", "ecxwb1", "ecxwb2",
"ecxexp", "ecxlin", or "excsigm", in which case a single model of the specified type it fit, and bnec returns a model
object of class "bayesnecfit".

If a vector of two or more of the available models is supplied, bnec returns a model object of class "bayesmanecfit"
containing model averaged predictions for the supplied models, providing they were successfully fitted.

Model averaging is achieved through a weighted sample of each fitted models posterior predictions, with weights derived
using the \code{\link[brms]{loo_model_weights}} from \pkg{brms}. Individual model fits can be extracted from the \code{mod_fits}
element and can be examined individually.

\code{model} may also be one of "all", meaning all of the available models will be fit;
"ecx" meaning only models excluding a specific NEC step parameter fill be fit; "nec" meaning only models with a specific NEC step
parameter will be fit; or "bot_free" meaning only models without a "bot" parameter (without a bottom plateau) will be fit.

Models are fit using model formula passed to \pkg{brms} You can view the model formula for each type X_HOW_X.
Other types can be added as required, please open an issue at the package site on GitHub to request an additional model.

All models provide an estimate for NEC For model types with "nec" as a prefix, NEC is directly estimated as a parameter
in the model. Models with "ecx" as a prefix are continuous curve models, typically used for extracting ECX values
from concentration response data. In this instance the NEC value is defined as the concentration at which there is
a user supplied (see \code{sig_val}) percentage certainty (based on the Bayesian posterior estimate) that the response
falls below the estimated value of the upper asymptote (top) of the response (i.e the response value is significantly
lower than that expected in the case of no exposure).
