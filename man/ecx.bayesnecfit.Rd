\usage{
\method{ecx}{bayesnecfit}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesnecfit}}
returned by \code{\link{bnec}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \code{\link{ecx}}}
}
\value{
A vector containing the estimated ECx value, including upper and lower 95\% credible interval bounds.
}
\description{
Extracts the predicted ECx value as desired from an object of class
\code{\link{bayesnecfit}}.
}
\details{
\code{type} "relative" is calculated as the percentage decrease from the maximum predicted value of the response (top) to the minimum predicted value
of the response. Type "absolute" (the default) is calculated as the percentage decrease from the maximum value of the response (top)
to 0 (or bot for a 4 parameter model fit). Type "direct" provides a direct estimate of the x value for a given y.
Note that for the current version, ECx for an "nechorme" (NEC Hormesis) model is estimated at a percent decline from the control.
For \code{hormesis_def}, if "max", then ECx values are calculated as a decline from the maximum estimates (i.e. the peak at nec);
if "control", then ECx values are calculated relative to the control, which is assumed to be the lowest observed concentration.
