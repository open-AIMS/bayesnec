## Warning

**This package is a work in progress. So, for the moment, we advise cautionary usage as some of the functionalities may change or become deprecated in future versions.**

## Overview 

`bayesnec` is a No-Effect-Concentration estimation package that uses [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) to fit concentration(dose)-response data using Bayesian methods for the purpose of estimating both ECX values, but more particularly NEC. Please see `?bayesnec` for more details.

## Installation

At this stage `bayesnec` is not hosted on CRAN R package network.
An alternative method of installation is to use the R `devtools` package.

R `devtools` can be installed using the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

After `devtools` has been installed `bayesnec` can be installed directly from GitHub using the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/AIMS/bayesnec")
```

This command will also install 2 dependencies `httr` and `jsonlite`.

## Usage

To populate.

## Further Information

Further information about `bayesnec` can be seen on the [project page](https://aims.github.io/bayesnec).
